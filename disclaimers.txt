1. There is scope of improvement and possibility of changing some flow in the app but as there was  less time for completing assignment and no one to ask doubts/flow, so I did as of my understanding. If you want to change something please let me know.

2. There is use of joins as am using onDelete:CASCADE and onUpdate: CASCADE, so if you delete some values, it will get deleted at multiple places, so be careful with delete operation, 

3. I have confusion about what values should be allowed to update in a model, so I choose which striked my mind at the moment. 

  ---In user model/table, user can update only his password and username is a unique field

  ---In Project model, project name can be updated, and a project can be assigned to some other user       	that means project owner can be updated but it is optional.

  ---In Task model, only task status can be updated.

  --- All update operations in Project and Task model can be performed by project owner itself, no    	one else, if this functionality need to be changed, please let me know and give some time, I 	will fix this.

4. For API documentation, I have used postman as swagger take more time to set up and modify 	objects. So for testing you must be logged in to postman and import the collection which I 	have attached.

5. After importing postman api docs or collection , change the environment variable as per the 	requirement, Local to run locally and deployed to run in cloud and change the variables 	accordingly. API docs link - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29795181/2sAYQWKZBv

6. Make a new registration and login and test with that as I can delete the values while used in 	testing.

7. Neon postgreSql  database  is used for this project (free version)
