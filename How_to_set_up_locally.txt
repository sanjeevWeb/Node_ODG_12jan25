---------------How to run the app locally----------------------

steps-------->

## Make sure you have Node installed on system and PostgreSQL also or running in some service provider like neon.

## clone the folder with this command-> 
   >>git clone https://github.com/sanjeevWeb/Node_ODG_12jan25.git

## make a .env and run command
  >>npm i

## in .env  file make variables, POSTGRESQL_DB_URI, PORT and JWT_SECRET and set appropriate values.

## go to postman and import collection attached with this repo.

## make sure server is running, choose local environment to run on localhost, set variable {{developement}}, as I have done there

## start hitting apis endpoints with appropriate body/params, I have saved endpoints for reference.

## use new register and login user, I can erase previous data from database (in deploy enviroment)

## relationships between tables will apply, so update and delete functionality will  behave accordingly.
